Working directory --> Staging Area --> Git repository.

Working directory is the directory where you initialize your repository,
i.e, git init
here it is Story directory. After this .git folder (hidden) comes.

Then we have to git add filename
We now come to staging area. This area tracks all the changes.
It determines which files to add changes to.

Then git commit -m "Message"
Now our file is under local repository and that version is given a name using commit message.

git checkout filename
Do this to delete current version of file and come back to previous version.

We learnt about local git implementations. i.e, saving changes to local computers.



git remote add origin url

When we want to add existing repository from command line,
this is basically telling local git that I have created a remote repository and name of remote is origin.
url of remote git repo.
Now we can push our local repo to remote repo which is called origin.


git branch -M main
git push -u origin main





git rm --cached -r.
remove all files from staging area.


To create new txt file in powershell,
New-Item C:\Users\etc





.gitignore lets us not show some imp files in github repo
For git ignore,
New-Item location\.gitignore




BRANCH

git branch branchname
This creates a new branch.

git branch
this shows all branches and branch you currently are in with green.

git checkout branchname
Switches the branch to given branchname.
